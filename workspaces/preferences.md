description: Learn how to manage your Coder account preferences.
---

The **User Preferences** area of the Coder UI allows you to manage your account.

To access **User Preferences**, click on your avatar in the top-right, then
click on either **Account** or your avatar in the drop-down menu.

## Account

The **Account** tab allows you to provide or change:

- Your avatar
- Your display name
- Email address
- Username (this is the value that Coder uses throughout the platform, including
  dev URLs and the CLI's SSH configuration)
- Your dotfiles URI to personalize your workspaces

## Security

The **Security** tab allows you to change your password if you log in using
built-in authentication (that is, you log in by providing an email/password
combination).

> You cannot change the passwords for accounts authenticated via Open ID Connect
> using the Coder platform. However, your password may be changeable within your
> organization's account management system. See your system administrator for
> more information.

## SSH keys

The **SSH Keys** page is where you'll find the public key corresponding to the
private key that Coder inserts automatically into your workspaces. The public
key is useful for services, such as Git, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab, that you
need to access from your workspace.

If necessary, you can regenerate your key. Be sure to provide your updated key
to all of the services you use. Otherwise, they won't work.

> The SSH public keys use the
> [Ed25519 key algorithm](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8709) instead
> of the more commonly used RSA algorithm. Recent publications
> ([example](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto/read#leanpub-auto-chapter-5-digital-signatures))
> suggest that Ed25519 is preferable to RSA. OpenSSH has supported Ed25519 SSH
> keys since [version 6.5](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.5), released
> in 2014.

## Linked accounts

The **Linked Accounts** tab allows you to automatically provide your Coder SSH
key to the Git service of your choice. You can then perform the Git actions in
your Coder workspace and interact with the service (e.g., push changes).

## Notifications

You can choose to allow Coder to display native **notifications** so that you
can receive necessary alerts even when focused on a different view or page.

Coder issues desktop notifications when you create a new workspace or rebuild an
workspace.

Please note that:

- You may not receive native notifications when using your browser's private
  browsing mode
- You must enable native notifications for each browser on which you run Coder
  Enterprise

You can check whether notifications are enabled and working by click **Test**.

## Autostart

Autostart allows you to set the time when Coder automatically starts and builds
your workspaces. See [Autostart](autostart.md) for more information.

## Dark theme

> Dark theme is currently a beta feature.

If you'd like to use Coder's dark theme, you can enable it by clicking on your
avatar and selecting **Feature Preview**. Then, click **Dark theme** and select
**Enable**.
